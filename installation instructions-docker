Yes, there is a **Docker image for BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)** ‚Äî both official and community-maintained versions are available. Using Docker is often easier and cleaner than installing directly on the host.

## ‚úÖ Official Docker Image (from BeEF project)

### üîó GitHub:

[https://github.com/beefproject/beef/tree/master/docker](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/tree/master/docker)

## üê≥ How to Run BeEF via Docker on Ubuntu (AWS EC2)

### 1. **Install Docker (if not already installed)**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

### 2. **Clone BeEF Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beefproject/beef.git
cd beef/docker
```

### 3. **Build the Docker Image**

```bash
docker build -t beef .
```

> This will take a few minutes as it installs dependencies and configures BeEF inside the container.

### 4. **Run the Container**

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 6789:6789 beef
```

* `3000`: BeEF web UI ([http://your-ip:3000/ui/panel](http://your-ip:3000/ui/panel))
* `6789`: WebSocket for hook.js (used for communication)

> You can also map port 80 or 443 if you plan to reverse proxy with HTTPS.

---

### 5. **Access BeEF**

* **Web UI**: `http://your-ec2-public-ip:3000/ui/panel`
* **Hook URL**: `http://your-ec2-public-ip:3000/hook.js`
* **Default credentials**:

  * Username: `beef`
  * Password: `beef`

### ‚úÖ Optional: Run with Docker Compose

If you'd rather use Docker Compose:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  beef:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "6789:6789"
```

Run it:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Want to Secure It with HTTPS?

You can still use **Nginx + Let's Encrypt** as a reverse proxy in front of your Docker container:

* Docker exposes on `localhost:3000`
* Nginx proxies from `https://yourdomain.com` to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

Let me know if you want the full Docker + HTTPS reverse proxy setup.
